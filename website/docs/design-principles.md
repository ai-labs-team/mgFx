title: Design Principles
---

- **Clear Architecture** - There should be clearly identifiable boundaries between the different components that mgFx provides. Related documentation should be equally simple.

- **Minimal Opinions** - The core concepts required to understand mgFx (and any application using it) should be kept to a minimum. Less general concepts should be lifted to additional, optional layers of functionality.

- **Flexibility** - Through well-defined boundaries, users should feel free to add, remove, extend or otherwise customize components as they see fit without penalty.
